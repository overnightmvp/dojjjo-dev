# 02. ICP Intelligence // THE VULNERABLE AUTHORITY

## Stop Trying to Save Everyone
Most agencies fail because they try to sell "SEO" to a local bakery. The bakery doesn't care.

We are hunting a specific type of prey: **The Vulnerable Authority.**
These are businesses that *should* be the leaders, but are being eaten alive by AI "Wrappers" and VC-backed competitors who understand the digital game better than they do.

### The 3 Targets (High Pain-to-Pay)

#### 1. The Displaced SaaS Leader (Series B/C)
*   **The Story:** They spent 5 years building the best product. But a new startup just launched a "wrapper" and is stealing all the AI mentions because they have better documentation.
*   **The Pain:** "Why is ChatGPT recommending [Competitor] when their product sucks?"
*   **The Check:** $5,500/mo (Easy yes).

#### 2. The Invisible Consultant (High-Ticket)
*   **The Story:** They charge $50k for advice. But the AI is scraping their blogs and giving the advice for free, without attributing it to them.
*   **The Pain:** "I am being plagiarized by a robot."
*   **The Check:** $2,000/mo (Protection money).

#### 3. The Industrial Giant (Manufacturing)
*   **The Story:** They have the best specs in the world... buried in a PDF from 2003.
*   **The Pain:** Procurement agents (AI bots) can't read their catalog, so they get skipped for every RFP.
*   **The Check:** $10k Project (Technical Cleanup).
