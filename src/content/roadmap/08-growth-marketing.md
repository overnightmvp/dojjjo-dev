## Stop Burning Cash on "Brand Awareness"
Nobody cares about your brand yet. They care about their problem.
We don't buy ads to say "Look at us."
We buy ads to ask: **"Why is the AI ignoring you?"**

### The "Surround Sound" Strategy
We need to be everywhere the client looks *after* they receive our cold call.

#### 1. Google Ads (The Fear Bids)
*   **The Keyword:** "AI Visibility Audit" or "GEO Services."
*   **The Competitor Bid:** Bid on your competitor's name.
*   **The Copy:** *"Why is [Competitor] ranking on Perplexity and you aren't?"*

#### 2. Meta Retargeting (The Proof)
*   **The Creative:** A 30-second screen recording of you asking ChatGPT "Who is the best?" and it failing to mention them.
*   **The Headline:** *"Your brand is invisible to 90% of buyers. Fix it."*

#### 3. X/LinkedIn Automation (The Sniper)
*   **The DM:** We don't pitch. We send the "Audit Video."
*   **The Hook:** *"I made a video showing how Gemini is hallucinating your pricing. Want to see it?"*

### 🧠 Introspection Prompt
Google your brand name + "VS [Competitor]".
**Does the result make you look like the clear winner, or just another option?**
If you don't control the comparison, you lose the deal.
