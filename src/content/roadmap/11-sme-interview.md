# 11. SME Interview // EXTRACTING THE MOAT

## The Only 30 Minutes That Matter
You are not an expert in their industry. **They are.**
Your job is not to create content. It is to **Extract Authority**.

We do not ask them to "write a blog post." We act as investigative journalists.

### The Extraction Protocol (30 Minutes)
1.  **The Lie:** *"What is the #1 thing everyone in your industry believes | that is actually false?"* (This creates contrarian authority).
2.  **The Danger:** *"What is the most dangerous advice currently being given by AI bots about your sector?"* (This identifies the gap).
3.  **The Proof:** *"Give me your top 3 case studies where you saved a client from disaster."* (This is the evidence).
4.  **The Prediction:** *"Where will this industry be in 2 years?"* (This creates thought leadership).

**Record it. Transcribe it. Feed it to the LLM.**
Now you have 3 months of content.

### 🧠 Introspection Prompt
**Can you speak your client's language better than their sales team?**
If not, you haven't done the extraction. AI rewards **Specific Expertise**, not generic fluff.
