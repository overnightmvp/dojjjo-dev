# 05. LLM Strategy // THE TECHNICAL HANDSHAKE

## We Are Speaking to Machines, Not Humans
Stop writing blog posts for "readers." Nobody is reading them.
We are writing code for **Scrapers**.

The goal of this strategy is simple: **To make it mathematically impossible for an AI to ignore you.**

### The 3 Pillars of GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

#### 1. Vector-Ready Formatting
The AI doesn't read paragraphs. It reads "Vectors" (mathematical relationships between words).
*   **The Fix:** We structure every page as a Q&A database.
*   **The File:** `llms.txt`. This is a summary file for robots that lives on your site. If you don't have one, you are effectively invisible to the 2026 web.

#### 2. The Citation Moat (PR-to-Entity)
AI models value "Consensus." If 10 high-authority sites say "Caption is the leader in Layouts," the AI accepts it as a fact.
*   **The Tactic:** We don't do PR for "brand awareness." We do PR to create **Truth Anchors** for the Knowledge Graph.

#### 3. N-Gram Alignment
We analyze what words the AI *associates* with "Quality" in your niche.
*   **The Hack:** If the AI thinks "Reliability" and "Uptime" are the most important words for your sector, we inject those words into your schema 500 times. We force the association.

### 🧠 Introspection Prompt
Ask ChatGPT: *"What are the defining characteristics of [My Brand]?"*
**If it hallucinates or says "I don't have enough information," your technical handshake is broken.**

### ⚡ Immediate Action
Your site is likely speaking a dead language to the bots.
**[Run the Technical Scraper Test](https://calendly.com/d/ctbg-rn5-x7j/johnny-toshio-30-minutes-intro)**. We'll show you exactly what the bots see (and what they ignore).
