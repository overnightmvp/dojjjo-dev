# 10. Launch Sprint // GETTING TO CASH (7 DAYS)

## Speed is a Moat
Most agencies spend 3 months building a website.
We spend 3 days building a **Bank Account**.

You do not need a logo. You do not need business cards.
You need **Proof of Concept**.

### The 7-Day Attack Plan

*   **Day 1: The Hit List.** Find 50 companies in your ICP. Verify they are invisible on Perplexity. Screenshot the failure.
*   **Day 2: The Identity.** Update LinkedIn to "Authority Architect." Post one thread: "Why [Industry] is invisible to AI."
*   **Day 3: The Call.** Dial 20 CEOs. Script: "I found a technical error in your AI indexing."
*   **Day 4: The Loom.** Send the 3-minute video audit to everyone who picked up.
*   **Day 5: The Follow-Up.** "Did you see the report? Your competitor is winning."
*   **Day 6: The Setup.** Prepare your `llms.txt` template.
*   **Day 7: The Cash.** Close the first $2k deal.
