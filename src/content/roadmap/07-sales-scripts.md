# 07. Sales Scripts // THE AI AUDIT HOOK

## Cold Calling is Dead? No, *You* Are.
If you call a CEO and say "Hi, I'd like to learn about your marketing goals," you deserve to be hung up on.
That is begging.
We do not beg. We **Inform**.

### The "Fiduciary Failure" Script
This script works because it reports a technical failure. It triggers the CEO's fear of negligence.

**The Opener:**
*"Hi [Name], I’m calling from DOJJJO. I just ran a Perplexity search for '[Industry Providers]' and I noticed a technical error. Your company has been completely filtered out of the results, and the AI is actively recommending [Competitor] instead. Are you aware of this gap?"*

*   **Why it works:** You aren't selling. You are reporting a fire.
*   **The Pivot:** *"It looks like a Schema error. The AI can't read your authority signals. I have the report here—do you want me to send over the screenshot of what the AI is saying about you?"*

### The LinkedIn DM (Receipts)
**Subject:** Your AI Visibility Gap (Report Attached)

*"Name, your 'Digital Moat' is leaking. Gemini is citing [Competitor] as the category leader because they have the correct `llms.txt` protocol. You don't. I've attached the audit showing the blindspot. Let's fix this before Q3."*

### The "No" Reversal
**Client:** "We have an SEO agency."
**You:** *"I know. And they are optimizing for Google 2024. I am talking about Perplexity 2026. Your agency is getting you ranked on a search engine nobody uses anymore. Do you want to fix the AI gap, or just keep ranking for keywords?"*

### 🧠 Introspection Prompt
Read your current sales script out loud.
**Does it sound like a Consultant offering value, or a beggar asking for time?**
If you use the words "check in" or "learn more," burn it.
