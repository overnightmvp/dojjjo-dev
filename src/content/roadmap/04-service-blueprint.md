# 04. Service Blueprint // THE LOOP FACTORY

## Stop Being an Artist. Be a Factory.
The reason you are burned out is because you treat every client like a custom art project.
You cannot scale "custom." You can only scale a **Protocol**.

This backend isn't designed to be "creative." It is designed to be a relentlessly efficient assembly line that prints Authority Assets.

### The 3-Phase Fulfillment Machine
*(Note: This executes in 30 days flat. No delays.)*

#### Phase 1: The Digital Foundation (Days 1-7)
*   **The Audit:** We run the code. We spot the "Broken Entities."
*   **The Extraction:** ONE 30-minute interview with the SME (Subject Matter Expert). That's it.
*   **The Handshake:** We deploy `llms.txt` to the root directory. The machine now knows you exist.

#### Phase 2: Signal Injection (Days 8-21)
*   **Concept Mapping:** We publish 4 technical "Definition" articles that define the category terms.
*   **PR Anchors:** We buy 2-3 placements on high-DA sites (Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, Industry Journals).
*   **Why?** Because Perplexity trusts these sites more than it trusts you. We are "borrowing" their authority.

#### Phase 3: The Outbound Assault (Days 22-30)
*   **The Weapon:** We take the data from Phase 1 and give it to your sales team.
*   **The Call:** "Hey, I saw Perplexity is recommending your competitor. Want to see why?"
*   **The Result:** Meetings based on **Fear**, not desire.

### 🧠 Introspection Prompt
Look at your current delivery process.
**If 50 clients signed up tomorrow, would your business break?**
If the answer is YES, you don't have a business. You have a job.
