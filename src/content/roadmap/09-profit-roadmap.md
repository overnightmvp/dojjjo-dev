# 09. Profit Roadmap // THE VALUE LADDER

## The $2k Client is a Trojan Horse
We sell the "Loop" at $2,000/mo because it is a "No-Brainer" entry point.
But you cannot build a $10M agency on $2k checks.
You build it on **Client Ascenscion.**

### The Upsell Path (From Vendor to Partner)

#### Tier 1: The Loop ($2,000/mo)
*   **What it is:** Basic Infrastructure. `llms.txt`. 1 PR link.
*   **The Goal:** Prove you can get **ONE** citation.
*   **Timeframe:** Month 1-2.

#### Tier 2: The Authority ($5,500/mo)
*   **The Trigger:** "We got you into Perplexity. Now let's dominate the entire sector."
*   **The Value:** 700+ Link Injections (Velocity).
*   **The Sell:** "Do you want to own 10% of the AI's mindshare, or 80%?"

#### Tier 3: The Sovereign Partnership ($10k+ /mo + %)
*   **The Trigger:** You are generating leads for them.
*   **The Value:** You take over their entire sales funnel (CRM + Closing).
*   **The Sell:** "We are no longer a cost. We are your revenue engine."
