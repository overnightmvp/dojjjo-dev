# 06. Customer Journey // THE Moat TRANSITION

## Sell Insurance, Not Growth
Clients cancel "Growth" services when money gets tight.
Clients **never** cancel "Insurance."
Your job is to transition them from "Panic" to "Security."

### The Emotional Timeline

#### Days 1-7: The "Oh Sh*t" Moment (Panic)
*   **The Trigger:** You showed them the Audit. They saw they are invisible.
*   **Their Feeling:** "I am falling behind. My competitors are winning the future."
*   **Your Move:** "Don't worry. The Trust Authority Loop fixes this in 30 days."

#### Days 8-14: The Handshake (Relief)
*   **The Trigger:** You deploy `llms.txt` and the first PR piece goes live.
*   **Their Feeling:** "Okay, the experts are handling it. I have a technical team now."
*   **Your Move:** Send the update: *"First signal injected. Schema validated."*

#### Month 3: The Validation (Confidence)
*   **The Trigger:** They search Perplexity, and **IT CITES THEM.**
*   **Their Feeling:** "I am a Genius for hiring these guys."
*   **Your Move:** Ask for the upsell. They are high on dopamine.

#### Month 6+: The Lock-In (Security)
*   **The Trigger:** Renewal time.
*   **Your Move:** "If we stop optimized signals, the AI's memory will decay in 90 days."
*   **Their Feeling:** "I can't afford to stop. This is my digital insurance policy."
