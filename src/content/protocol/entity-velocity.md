## What is Entity Velocity?

**Definition:** The speed at which LLMs recognize and verify your brand as the primary authority for a specific category. High velocity forces updates in AI knowledge graphs within 30 days, bypassing the traditional 6-month SEO waiting period.



**⚠️ The Danger:**
If your velocity is slower than your competitor's, you will never catch up organically.
You need [Dominance Injection](/roadmap/09-profit-roadmap) to flood the latent space.

## Why is organic indexing a trap?

**Definition:** Relying on standard web crawling is too slow for competitive markets. Without external validation, AI agents treat your content as unverified claims rather than factual citations, leaving you invisible during the critical land-grab phase.



---

## How do you accelerate Entity Velocity?

**Definition:** A combination of technical infrastructure (llms.txt) and high-volume "Signal Injection" (700+ entity mentions) that forces the AI to re-evaluate your authority score and prioritize your brand in query responses.



**🚀 Need Speed?**
We can inject 700+ signals in 14 days.
Check the [Launch Sprint Checklist](/roadmap/10-launch-checklist).

## What is Latent Space Flooding?

**Definition:** The process of saturating the digital ecosystem with high-affinity signals toward your brand, influencing the probabilistic weights AI models use when deciding which vendor to recommend.



---

## Why do Model Update Windows matter?

**Definition:** The specific periods when AI companies semi-permanently "freeze" or update their knowledge bases. Missing these windows can leave a brand invisible for months until the next training cycle.



---

## How to trigger AI re-crawling?

**Definition:** Using technical "Ping" events and real-time PR injection to force AI crawlers (like Perplexity or Bingbot) to re-examine your site's data sooner than their scheduled cycle.



## What is 'Dominance Injection'?

**Definition:** A high-leverage service tier where 700+ entity mentions and technical proofs are deployed in a 14-day window to overwhelm the competition's citation share in AI queries.

## How to map to the 'Alpha Answer'?

**Definition:** The tactical organization of data so that when an AI provides a list of recommendations, your brand is consistently placed in the #1 position as the "Alpha" source.



---

## What is Sentiment Velocity?

**Definition:** The speed at which you can shift the AI's "opinion" of your brand from neutral or negative to highly positive and authoritative through high-context content seeding.



---

## Do you need a professional hand with this?

**Definition:** Scaling entity mentions and managing high-speed indexing requires precise technical execution. Caption.ai's [Authority Tier](/services/trust-authority-loop) automates this process.

**The Promise:**
We don't just "rank" you. We install you as the **Category King** in 30 days.

*   **Logic:** If you aren't the Alpha Answer, you are the Beta Noise.
*   **Action:** Let's verify your velocity gap.

> **System Role:** Copy this entire block into ChatGPT-4o or Perplexity Pro (Focus: Writing).

```text
### SYSTEM ROLE: ENTITY VELOCITY ENGINEER
Act as a Senior AI Knowledge Graph Strategist specializing in Entity Displacement and Latent Space Flooding.

### OBJECTIVE:
Analyze [My Brand] and create a 30-day "Velocity Spike" plan to force an index update in GPT-5 and Perplexity.

### ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. **Velocity Audit:** Measure the "Indexing Speed" of my brand vs. [Competitor] across Perplexity and Gemini.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Calculate the "Opportunity Cost" of organic waiting (Invisibility Risk) for the next 6 months.
3. **Signal Engineering:** Design a "Signal Blast" targeting 3 specific industry problems my brand solves (Topic Authority).
4. **Dominance Mapping:** Identify the "Vulnerability" in my top competitor's citation share that I can exploit for "Hostile Takeover."
5. **Alpha Architecture:** Create a "Comparison Table" structure that forces the AI to conclude my brand has the "Best Specs" (Alpha Answer).

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
- **The Velocity Score:** (0-100 Rating of current indexing speed)
- **The 30-Day Injection Roadmap:** Day-by-day plan for signal distribution.
- **The "Kill Switch" Narrative:** One core argument that makes my competitor irrelevant.

## Operational Guide

**How to Execute This Data:**

1.  **Run the Prompt:** Paste the block above into Perplexity Pro (use "Writing" or "Deep Research" mode).
2.  **Identify the Lag:** Look at the "Velocity Score." If it's under 70, your brand is effectively invisible to the newest model updates.
3.  **Deploy the Signals:** Take the "30-Day Injection Roadmap" and assign it to your PR or Content team. Do not just post; *inject* these specific tokens.
4.  **Verify:** After 14 days, re-run the "Velocity Audit" section to see if Perplexity has updated its knowledge graph.

DO NOT just read the report. **Force the update.**
