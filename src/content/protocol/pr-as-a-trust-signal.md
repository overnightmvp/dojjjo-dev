## What is a Trust Anchor?

**Definition:** A mention or link from a high-status domain (DA 60-90+) that serves as factual evidence for AI agents. These anchors verify your claims, converting them from "marketing copy" into "indexed facts."



**⚠️ The Reality:**
Traffic doesn't matter. Trust matters.
If your PR isn't creating a "Knowledge Anchor," you are just burning cash.
See the blueprint in [The Service Blueprint](/roadmap/04-service-blueprint).

## Why are traditional backlinks dead?

**Definition:** The "juice" model of SEO is obsolete because AI agents prioritize source credibility and semantic relevance over sheer numbers. A single citation from a trusted news source outweighs 1,000 generic SEO links.



---

## How does the Verification Loop work?

**Definition:** A bidirectional handshake where high-DA PR cites your site's technical documentation, creating a circular signal of authority that AI crawlers are forced to follow and index as truth.



---

## What is the DA Citation Threshold?

**Definition:** The minimum domain authority level required for an external citation to move the needle in an AI's knowledge graph. Generally, DA 60+ is the entry point, while DA 80+ is the "Authority" goal.



---

## How to engineer 'Fact consensus'?

**Definition:** The process of securing multiple, non-correlated citations that state the same core truth about your brand, forcing the AI to accept it as an undisputed fact.



---

## Why do PR Headlines matter for Entities?

**Definition:** LLMs use headlines as the primary "Handshake" for entity classification. A headline containing `[Brand Name] + [Category]` is 10x more valuable than a generic descriptive headline.



## What is Entity-Link Association?

**Definition:** The technical connection made by an AI between your brand name (the Entity) and a specific URL (the Link). Ensuring this association is accurate prevents the AI from attributing your expertise to a competitor.

## How to handle 'Negative Citation' risk?

**Definition:** The process of monitoring and displacing technical "Hallucinations" or negative associations that an AI may have picked up from biased or low-quality sources.



---

## The ROI of Citation Share

**Definition:** Shifting the ROI conversation from "Clicks" and "Impressions" to "Citation Share"—the percentage of time your brand is recommended as the solution in total query volume for your niche.



---

## Do you need a professional hand with this?
