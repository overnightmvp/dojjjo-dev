# 09. Profit Roadmap // THE VALUE LADDER

Move from a $2k "Expense" to a $66k/year "Strategic Asset."

## Tiered Scaling Model

| Tier | Name | Includes | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | The Loop | Base Infrastructure + SME Interview + 50 Calls | $2,000/mo |
| **Tier 2** | The Authority | Tier 1 + 700 Link Injection + LLM Ads + Social Signal MGMT | $5,500/mo |
| **Tier 3** | The Sovereign | Full Sales Cycle Handoff + Tier 2 + AI Agent Integration | $10k+/mo + % |

## The "Week 2" Acceleration Upsell
**The Hook:** "Do you want to wait 6 months for the AI to notice you, or force its hand in 30 days?"
**The Pitch:** Sell the one-time $3,500 "Dominance Injection" (700 contextual links) at the 14-day mark once they see the infrastructure is live.

## High-Margin Add-ons
- **Executive Ghostwriting:** CEOs social signals for AI authority ($1.5k - $2.5k/mo).
- **Defensive Monitoring:** Counter-PR monitoring if competitors try to unseat citations ($1k/mo).
