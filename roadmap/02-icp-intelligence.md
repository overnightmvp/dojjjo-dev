# 02. ICP Intelligence // THE VULNERABLE AUTHORITY

We don't target "B2B." We target companies with high-stakes expertise currently being "stolen" or "diluted" by generic AI answers.

## Target Segments

### 1. Series B/C SaaS
- **Why They Pay:** They need to defend category leadership against VC-backed "wrappers."
- **The Pain:** AI is recommending competitors because their "Entity Mapping" is superior.

### 2. High-Ticket Consulting
- **Why They Pay:** Their "Thought Leadership" is being scraped without attribution.
- **The Pain:** They are invisible in "Who is the top consultant for [X]?" queries.

### 3. Industrial / Manufacturing
- **Why They Pay:** Technical buyers use Gemini to find suppliers with specific specs.
- **The Pain:** 20 years of PDF catalogs are "dead data" to AI crawlers.

## The "AI Gap" Reality
Based on 2026 data, if a brand isn't in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context window, it doesn't exist. You are selling **AI Insurance**.
