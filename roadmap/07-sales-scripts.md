# 07. Sales Scripts // THE AI AUDIT HOOK

We lead with a technical failure report, not a pitch. This is "Fiduciary Fear" conversion.

## 1. The Cold Call Opener
"Hi [Name], I’m with Caption. I just ran a Perplexity search for '[Niche] Solutions' and your company was completely excluded from the citations. Your competitor, [Competitor], is the only one being recommended. Is your team currently managing your **Entity Mapping**, or are you letting the AI choose your competitors for you?"

### The Pivot
"Google ranking is for 2024. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) ensures AI recommends you. If the LLM doesn't see your infrastructure as 'authoritative,' you’re filtered out before a human even sees you. Can we see how to force your brand into those citations on Thursday at 2pm?"

## 2. The Entity Gap (LinkedIn)
"Hey [Name], I noticed [Your Company] has strong PR, but it's not being cited in AI-agent queries for [Industry]. We’ve developed a 'Trust Authority Loop' to fix that indexing gap. Worth a brief look?"

## 3. The "Receipts" Follow-up
Subject: Your AI Recommendation Gap (Audit Attached)

"Name, your 'Digital Moat' is leaking. AI is citing [Competitor] because they speak the machine language. I've attached a screenshot of how Gemini views your brand vs. how it should. Let's fix this in 30 days."
