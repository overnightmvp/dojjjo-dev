# 10. Launch Sprint // GETTING TO CASH (7 DAYS)

Stop building. Start auditing.

- **Day 1: The Evidence:** Find 50 companies in your ICP. Run Perplexity queries for each. Screenshot their omission.
- **Day 2: The MVB:** Update your LinkedIn headline to "AI Authority Architect." Post your first "Invisibility" thread.
- **Day 3: Call Alpha:** Start the "AI Gap" calls. Goal: 20 calls. Sell the *Audit*, not the service.
- **Day 4: Loom Production:** Record 3-minute personalized audits for everyone who said "Yes."
- **Day 5: The Hard Close:** Follow-up calls. Use the competitor's source code to show they are "speaking a dead language."
- **Day 6: Factory Kickoff:** Prepare your `llms.txt` templates and PR partner network.
- **Day 7: Cash & Kickoff:** Send the Stripe link for $2,000. Book the SME Interview.

**Coach's Final Word:** Most agencies spend 3 months building a website. You have 3 days to prove people are dying in the machine.
