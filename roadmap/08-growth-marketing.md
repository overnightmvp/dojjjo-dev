# 08. Growth Marketing // DEMAND GEN ARCHITECTURE

We use multi-channel triggers to create "Surround Sound" authority.

## 1. Google Ads (The Fear Bids)
- **Strategy:** Bid on "Competitive Displacement" and "LLM Visibility."
- **Keywords:** "Why is [Competitor] recommended by Perplexity?", "GEO services", "AI visibility audit."

## 2. Meta (The Authority Funnel)
- **Creative:** Screenshot recordings of LLMs excluding the brand vs. including it.
- **Hook:** "I asked Gemini who the best provider is, and it hallucinated. Here's why."

## 3. LinkedIn & X (Account-Based)
- **Automation:** Reach out to CEOs of "Invisible" companies.
- **DM:** "I just queried your sector and the AI bots have a bias against you. Want the Loom showing how we flip the script?"

## 4. X Organic (The Proof Engine)
- **Threads:** "How we forced a $100M brand into Perplexity's citations."
- **Focus:** Dwell-time on high- Fidelity technical contrarianism.
