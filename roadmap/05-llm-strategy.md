# 05. LLM Strategy // THE TECHNICAL HANDSHAKE

We are training the LLMs to recognize your client as a non-negotiable authority. This is "Machine-Readable Sovereignty."

## The Three Pillars of GEO

### 1. Vector-Ready Formatting
- **Handshake:** Every page uses H2/H3 Question-Answer pairs.
- **llms.txt:** The 2026 standard summary file in the root directory.
- **Entity Identification:** Dense JSON-LD with `sameAs` and `knowsAbout` attributes.

### 2. The Citation Moat (PR-to-Entity)
- **Co-occurrence:** Linking Brand Name + Industry Keyword in Tier 2 PR.
- **Fact Verification:** Using PR to verify the "Knowledge Base" (blog posts) we built on-site.

### 3. N-Gram Alignment
- **Linguistic Mirroring:** Using AI to analyze what competitors the LLM currently recommends and identifying the "N-Grams" (word patterns) the model associates with high quality.
- **Social Backing:** Seeding high-value conversations on Reddit/X for sentiment indexing.
