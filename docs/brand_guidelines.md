# Brand Guidelines: Industrial Authority

The Caption brand is built on three pillars: **Technical Superiority**, **Brutal Honesty**, and **Fiduciary Responsibility**.

## 1. Visual Identity

### The Palette
- **Deep Charcoal (`#0A0A0B`):** Dominant background. Represents the hidden "Latent Space" of AI.
- **Neon Cobalt (`#3B82F6`):** Action/Accent color. Represents the "Signal" in the noise.
- **Surface Gray (`#141416`):** For UI components (cards/sections).
- **Pure White (`#FFFFFF`):** For high-impact typography.

### Typography
- **Headings:** `Outfit` (Bold, -0.02em letter spacing). Clean, modern, authoritative.
- **Body:** `Inter` (Regular/Medium). High readability, technical feel.
- **Technical/Code:** `JetBrains Mono` or standard Monospace. For SOPs and Protocol assets.

## 2. Imagery & Assets
- **The Style:** No "stock people." Use high-fidelity data visualizations, nodes-and-wires networks, and 3D technical schematics.
- **Texture:** Subtle grain, glassmorphism (translucency), and neon glows.
- **Motion:** Micro-animations for buttons, "typing" effects for AI responses, and slow-drift data grids.

## 3. UI Principles (Astro Components)
- **The Handshake:** Visual indicators of "Machine-Readability" (e.g., green checkmarks for schema validation).
- **The Terminal:** Use terminal-style boxes for technical data to establish the "Architect" persona.
- **The Data Gap:** Use high-contrast charts (Pie/Bar) to show the "Citation Gap" vs. competitors.

---

## 4. Voice & Tone
- **Archetype:** The "Authority Architect."
- **Tone:** Direct, technical, and high-status. We don't "help" companies; we "install authority."
- **Keywords:** Authority, Protocol, Injection, Anchor, Moat, Handshake, Velocity.
