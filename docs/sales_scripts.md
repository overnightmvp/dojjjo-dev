# Sales Scripts: The "AI Gap" Methodology

## 1. The Cold Call: "The Visibility Vulnerability"
**Opener:**  
"Hi [Name], I’m calling from Caption. I’ll be brief: I just ran a search on Perplexity for '[Their Category] Solutions,' and you weren't just buried—you were completely excluded. [Competitor Name] is currently the only one being recommended. Are you guys choosing to let the AI ignore you, or did your SEO team just miss the shift to LLM indexing?"

**The Pivot:**  
"Google ranking is 2024 tech. AI visibility is 2026. If the LLM doesn't see your technical data as 'authoritative,' you’re invisible to 40% of B2B buyers today. I have the audit in front of me—do you have 7 minutes on Thursday to see how we force your brand into those citations?"

## 2. LinkedIn Sequence: The "Entity Gap"
**Touch 1 (Connection):**  
"Hey [Name], noticed [Company] has strong PR but it's not being cited in AI-agent queries for [Industry]. We’ve developed a 'Trust Authority Loop' to fix that indexing gap. Worth a look?"

**Touch 2 (Message):**  
"[Name], attached is a screenshot of how an AI currently views your brand vs. how it should. You have the authority—you just don't have the handshake. Open to the fix?"

## 3. Email Sequence: "The Machine-Readable Moat"
**Subject:** Your AI Recommendation Gap (Audit Attached)

**Body:**  
[Name],  
When a prospect asks an AI agent for a recommendation, the LLM looks for two things: Technical Infrastructure and Verified Authority signals.  
Right now, your 'Digital Moat' is leaking. [Competitor] is being cited because their technical data is structured for LLM consumption, while yours is trapped in standard web pages.  
We solve this in 30 days via our Trust Authority Loop. Can we discuss the 30-day build?

## 4. Upsell Script: "The Acceleration Gap" (Week 2)
**Goal:** Move $2k retainer to $5.5k Authority Tier.

"The technical infrastructure is live. However, now that we’re inside the data, I’ve spotted a massive risk. Your top competitor has a 3-year head start on 'Trust Signals.'  
We can stay at the current pace, or we can use our 'Dominance Injection'—700+ high-context entity mentions that force the LLMs to re-evaluate your authority score in 30 days instead of 180. It’s effectively a time machine for your visibility. Do you want to own this category by next month or wait for the organic crawl?"
