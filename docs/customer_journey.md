# Customer Journey Map: The Trust Authority Loop

This map outlines the end-to-end experience for a Caption client, from the initial "AI Gap" realization to becoming a long-term "Authority" partner.

- **Touchpoint 1:** Cold Outreach (Call/DM) reporting the AI Gap.
- **Touchpoint 2:** Delivery of the **AI Visibility Audit** (Loom/PDF).
- **Client Feeling:** Urgency, Fear of being left behind (FOMO).
- **The Threshold:** Client signs the $2k "Baseline" agreement.

## Phase 2: Onboarding & The Technical Handshake (Days 8-14)
**Goal:** Frictionless transition to machine-readability.
- **The SME Interview:** 30-minute high-velocity IP extraction.
- **Protocol Deployment:** Live deployment of `llms.txt` and Organization Schema.
- **Client Feeling:** Relief. They finally have a "moat" strategy.
- **Early Win:** The client sees their site crawlability score hit 100% for GPTBot/CCBot.

## Phase 3: Signal Injection & Implementation (Month 1)
**Goal:** Verifiable authority growth.
- **Content Engine:** 4 Technical Protocol assets go live.
- **The Signal:** 1x High-DA PR piece cites the technical assets.
- **Client Feeling:** Validation. They see "External Proof" of their expertise.

## Phase 4: The Validation Loop (Month 2)
**Goal:** Proof of ROI in the AI ecosystem.
- **The Authority Report:** First "Share of Model" (SoM) growth chart.
- **Outbound Sync:** The first set of meetings booked using the new "Authority" status.

## Phase 5: Retention & Authority (Month 6+)
**Goal:** Indispensable infrastructure partner.
- **Defensive Monitoring:** Monthly audits of competitor "Entity Hijacking" attempts.

## Retention Secrets (The "Glue")
1. **Never Report Clicks:** Humans click links; Machines cite entities. Report on Citations.
2. **The Loom Habit:** Send a monthly 60-second Loom showing a live Perplexity recommendation.
3. **The Moat Logic:** Remind the client that stopping the "Loop" allows the AI's mind to revert to competitors within 90 days.
