# Growth Marketing Strategy: The "Authority" Funnels

To scale the $2k/mo service, we use a multi-channel approach focused on "Executive Fear" and "Category Displacement."

## 1. Google Ads: The "Displacement" Funnel
- **Targeting:** Competitive keywords + Industry "Gap" queries.
- **Keywords:** `why is [Competitor] in perplexity`, `how to show up in chatgpt search`, `enterprise GEO services`.
- **The Hook:** "Your competitor is the only answer the AI gives. Fix your visibility in 30 days."
- **Landing Page:** A "Visibility Audit" tool or high-converting VSL (Video Sales Letter).

## 2. FB/IG Ads: The "Rescue" Funnel
- **Targeting:** Founders, CEOs, and CMOS of Series B+ companies.
- **Creative:** Screen recordings of AI "hallucinating" about an industry or omitting a major player.
- **The Hook:** "In 6 months, the AI's mind will be made up. Are you on the map or are you a ghost?"
- **Offer:** Direct-to-Lead-Form for a "Free AI Authority Audit."

## 3. LinkedIn & X: The "Social Signal" Funnel
- **X (Organic):** Automated contrarian threads. "Why your $10k/mo SEO agency is making you invisible to AI."
- **LinkedIn (ABM):** Account-Based Marketing targeting specific CEOs.
- **The DM:** "Hey [Name], I noticed that when querying [Process], the AI cited [Competitor] over you. We just built the infrastructure to flip that. Open to a 2-min Loom?"

## 4. Simple Outbound Funnel (The Baseline)
1. **Source:** Clay (Enrich with PR and AI citation data).
2. **Contact:** Cold Call (AI Gap Script) + Multi-channel follow-up (LinkedIn/Email).
3. **Proof:** 2-Minute Loom Audit.
4. **Close:** "The Authority Demo" (Stripe link for $2k).
